As soil depth is one feature in your data, you can include this site data by labling the depth =0 ). This may indicates that how soil curst showed different compared with other soils depths, associated with EFC distribution","Also, as your manuscript version of the model don't have soil moisture as a prediciton feature, I worry your model may not be able to simulate the change in EFC in resposne to time after wetting events.
